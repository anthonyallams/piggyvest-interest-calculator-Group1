# Safelock Interest Calculator By Group 1

Safelock Interest Calculator is programmed to make saving on Piggyvest more efficient by providing an easy way so users can calculate their total interest over a particular period of time.
The calculator is integrated with the Safelock start-up page for easy access to the users. It works on the principle of basic simple interest calculation (P*R*T/100) and has the following features:

    1. “Amount to lock” input: Holds the total amount to be locked;
    2. “Duration” input: Holds how long the capital is to be locked;
    3. “Interest”: This is based on the duration chosen by the user

Based on the percentage fixed to all available duration, interest is added to the amount input by the user to be locked by multiplying the amount with fixed rate and also with the interest rate. For example, assuming Mr. A is set to lock #100,000 away for a duration of two year, since the fixed interest a 2-year saving attracts is 13%, therefore Mr A’s return at the end of the two years will be calculated as:

(NGN100,000 _ 0.13 _ 2 years)/100
= NGN26,000

Therefore, at the 2 years, Mr. A’s total return will be #126,000 (gotten by addition of the NGN100,000 and the NGN26,000 interest)
